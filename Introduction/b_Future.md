# That's all Folks!

## Lexy Specifications

The lexy language describes itself with a collection of lexy scenarios and example functions. They define the expected output behavior and even expected compilation and validation errors. These specifications ensure that all lexy compiler implementations in all different languages have the same expected behavior. Have a look at the '[README](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md)' in the 'Specifications' folder for more information about the specifications.

### Last note

We hope you enjoyed the introduction!

Again, the main goal of Lexy is to encourage governments to publish their Tax Laws in a readable, transparent and executable form!

## What's next?

What's next? How can you help?
- Do you like the mission of Lexy? Share about Lexy on your social media?
- Do you want to contribute to Lexy? Have a look at the contribute paragraph on the [README](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/) of the lexy-language repository!
- [Check out the interactive DEMO!](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md) - View, edit and creat your own Lexy script from the browser. (Desktop Only)

### Do you have knowledge about Tax Laws? Or you'd like to contribute in another way?

How can you help?
- Implement your local Tax Laws in Lexy and publish them in public on GitHub as examples. They can be added to the publications.md if they are fairly complete.
- Convert the compiler to other languages so you can run Lexy scripts in your favourite language or existing code-base? (java, php, ruby, c, c++, rust, ...)
- Demand governments to publish the real Tax Lax used in their system as an executable Lexy script. First step is to be fully transparent about how taxes are calculated and about which exemptions are in the code or hidden in the Tax rules.
- Moderate the Discord or help management of the GitHub projects

If you want to work on any of these, please discuss first on **Discord** so that people are not working on the same compiler for example:
